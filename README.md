, Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 
The goal of our project is to assess the amount of employees retiring within a company. Of these retiring employees, we want to pull their titles as well as their eligibility to participate in a mentorship program. The requesting manager has given us a variety of data about these employees and wants to determine the impact of the "silver tsunami" on current and future employment rates at the company. To do this, we used SQL to create tables and queries to sync all of our data across multiple sources into one cohesive picture. We first wanted to count the number of retiring employees. We determined the retiring age using birthdates between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

## Results
- We found that 90,398 employees are retiring, as their birth dates fell between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 
- The majority of these employees retiring are Senior employees (Senior Engineers, Senior Staff) and the fewest are Managers. 
- There were 1,549 employees born in 1965, making them eligible for the mentorship program 
- The majority of these employees were not senior roles, (Engineers) and the fewest are Assistant Engineers. 

## Summary
We have reported that 90,398 employees are due to retire based on their birth year. This is a very large impact to the company. Of these employees, 13,505 started between 1985 and 1988, making them eligible for retirement. This means that the company should prepare for upwards of 15,000 people retiring year over year. The mentorship program does not have enough people to contribute to a 1:1 mentorship rate with new hires or people moving up with promotions within the company. I would say that there are not enough potential mentors to help ready the future of Pewlett Hackard.
